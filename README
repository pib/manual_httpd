This is a tiny Python HTTP server, which prompts the user for the
proper response to each request.

It's handy for debugging HTTP client code or reverse-engineering
HTTP-based protocols.

Warning: the server will trust Content-Length headers, and doesn't
attempt to handle large request bodies or anything malicious in any
way.
